qNoise: A generator of non-Gaussian colored noise

Description
qNoise is a non-gaussian colored random noise generator. It is a handy source of self-correlated noise for a great variety of applications. It depends on two parameters only: tau for controlling the autocorrelation, and q for controlling the statistics. This noise tends smoothly  for q = 1 to an  Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (colored gaussian) noise with autocorrelation tau. for q < 1 it is bounded noise and it is supra-Gaussian for q > 1.
The noise is generated  via a stochastic differential equation using the Heun method (a second order Runge-Kutta type integration scheme) and it is implemented as a stand-alone library in c++.
It Useful as input for numerical simulations, as a source of noise for controlling experiments using synthetic noise via micro-controllers and for a wide variety of applications.

Requirements
It is a stand-alone library with no dependencies other than the standard libraries.
Due to it's use of some functions from the <random> library the library currently works on c++11 or higher only.
This should be OK for most Macs and new Linux systems.
In some older systems it is possible that you need to add `-std=gnu++11` to your compilation flags.
